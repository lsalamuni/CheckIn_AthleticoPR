# CheckIn AthleticoPR

The idea behind the development of this code arose with the intention of streamlining the check-in process for Clube Athletico Paranaense's games. 
Essentially, its structure involves accessing the team's official website via Selenium to complete the check-in using the CPF of the club member/supporter.

The code operates by: 
* 1. accessing the club member's email;
* 2. checking the latest game available for check-in;
* 3. validating all registered CPFs;
* 4. confirming via email.

For an optimal replication of the project, please fill out the YAML files according to the requested information.
Naturally, the code will only be properly reapplied with valid CPFs of club members.

Due to changes in the HTML structure of the check-in page, updates to the code are made from time to time.
